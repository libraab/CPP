The best amongst you is he who pays his debts in the most handsome manner.
Adhere to righteousness even though you will not be able to do all acts of virtue Know that the best of your deeds is Salat (prayer) and that no one maintains his ablution except a believer 
The best of your leaders are those whom you love and who love you, who pray for you and you pray for them 
The worst of your leaders are those whom you hate and who hate you, and you send curses on them and they send curses on you 
Avoid that which I forbid you to do and do that which I command you to do to the best of your capacity 
Shall I tell you who has the best degree among people after him? A man who lives alone with a few sheep, performs the prayer, pays the zakat, and worships Allah without associating anything with him 
The best Jihad is the word of Justice in front of the oppressive Sultan.
